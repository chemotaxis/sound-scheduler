# Sound Scheduler

This is a command line tool to make a printable schedule of people operating the
sound board for services.

It tries to maintain a uniform distribution between operators over the time
period of the schedule, but also take into account when people are available.
For instance, some may be in choir for the morning service.

I would like to create an html file that can be printed using any browser.
